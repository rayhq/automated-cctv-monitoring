# Integrated CCTV and Firewall Based Smart Campus Security System

This project aims to develop a smart campus security system that integrates CCTV cameras and a firewall to provide a comprehensive security solution. The system will be able to monitor the campus in real-time, detect security threats, and automatically respond to them by blocking suspicious activities and alerting the security personnel.

## Features

- Real-time video surveillance using CCTV cameras
- Automatic threat detection using video analytics
- Firewall integration for blocking suspicious network activities
- Real-time alerts and notifications
- Web-based user interface for monitoring and controlling the system

## Technologies

- Python
- OpenCV for video processing
- Flask for the web-based user interface
- iptables for firewall management

## Getting Started

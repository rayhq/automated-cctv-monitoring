# Automated CCTV Monitoring System

**Project Type:** BTech Mini Project  
**Domain:** Computer Vision | Smart Campus Security  

---

## Abstract

The **Automated CCTV Monitoring System** is an AI-driven surveillance solution designed to automatically analyze real-time CCTV video streams and detect suspicious activities using computer vision techniques. The system reduces the need for continuous manual monitoring by providing automated event detection, logging, and a web-based dashboard for security personnel. This mini project focuses exclusively on the **CCTV-based surveillance module**, while future work will include integration with **firewall and network security systems** for a fully integrated smart campus security platform.
